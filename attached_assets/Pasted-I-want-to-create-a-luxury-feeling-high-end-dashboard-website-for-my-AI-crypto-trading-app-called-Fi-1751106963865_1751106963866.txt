I want to create a luxury-feeling, high-end dashboard website for my AI crypto trading app called FinFlow, with inspiration taken from the attached dashboard and sidebar screenshotsâ€”but do not copy them, only use them for design reference. The dashboard should feature a dark glassmorphic background with background blur, soft glows, and elegant UI panels. The sidebar should be inspired by the attached sidebar screenshot and include links to Dashboard, Portfolio, Stocks, Goals, Chat History, AI Chatbot, and Settings. The main dashboard should display high-level insights like Total Portfolio Value, 24h Trading Volume, Active Positions, Available Cash, and a Savings Progress Tracker showing how much the user has saved this month using FinFlow AI, along with a progress bar and percentage. Add an AI Trading Insights card showing actions recently taken by the assistant. Include a Bitcoin/Crypto price chart module similar in structure to the reference, with 24h/1W/1M toggle. Below, display the portfolio holdings in a clean, blurred table showing asset, value, change %, and allocation. Add visualizations like a donut chart showing financial distribution between Emergency Funds, Goals, and Investments. Include new sections such as an AI Sentiment widget (e.g., "Market Sentiment: Bullish"), a News Highlights box powered by AI, and a horizontal Goals Timeline. In the AI Chatbot section, embed a 3D animated robot assistant like the one from the provided Spline link. This bot should subtly follow the user's mouse or device movement in the background, giving the chatbot a futuristic, interactive personality. Use Inter font throughout the design, with tight letter spacing and light weight for headings, and reduced opacity for body text. Use Phosphor Icons (light weight only) for all icons. Animate all page and section content with fade-in, upward motion, and blur on scroll, giving it a polished, futuristic feel. Use neumorphic 3D glowing buttons, and make all cards glassmorphic with blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds. Add a sticky top navigation bar with anchor links to homepage sections only and apply background blur on scroll. On tablet and mobile breakpoints, collapse the sidebar into a burger menu that triggers a full-height tray menu sliding in from the right, with animated open/close transitions. This dashboard should feel sleek, intelligent, immersive, and designed for a premium AI-first fintech platform.
